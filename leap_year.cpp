/*
Write a leap_year.cpp program that:
  - Takes a year as input.
  - Checks to see if the year is a four-digit number.
  - Displays whether or not the year falls on a leap year.
There are 3 criteria that must be taken into account to identify a leap year:
  - If the year can be evenly divided by 4 then it is a leap year, howeverâ€¦
  - If that year can be evenly divided by 100, and it is not evenly divided by 400, then it is NOT a leap year.
  - If that year is evenly divisible by 400, then it is a leap year.

#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int year;
  
  std::cout << "Enter a four-digit year: ";
  std::cin >> year;

  if (std::to_string(year).length() == 4) {
    if (year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0 || year % 400 == 0) {
      std::cout << year << " is a leap year.\n";
    } else {
      std::cout << year << " is not a leap year.\n";
    }
  } else {
    std::cout << "That is not a four-digit number!\n";
